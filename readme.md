## GitLab CI

This project's static Pages are built by [GitLab CI][ci], following the steps
defined in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml):

```
image: python:3.5

pages:
  stage: 
    build
  script:
    - apt-get update && apt-get install locales-all
    - pip install "nikola[extras]"
    - nikola build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
```

This tells the runner to use Python 3.5, install the `locales-all` package and  install Nikola.

Optional ones are included by using the `[extra]` flag, such as Markdown and Jinja2 (instead of just installing Docutils and Maco). You can drop the `[extras]` part and install optional features by hand if you need them instead. This is documented in [Nikola's getting started guide.](https://getnikola.com/getting-started.html)

## Building locally

To work locally with this project, you'll have to follow the steps below:

1. Fork, clone or download this project
1. [Install][] Nikola
1. Generate the website: `nikola build`
1. Preview your project: `nikola serve`
1. Add content

Read more at Nikola's [documentation][].

## GitLab User or Group Pages

To use this project as your user/group website, you will need one additional
step: just rename your project to `namespace.gitlab.io`, where `namespace` is
your `username` or `groupname`. This can be done by navigating to your
project's **Settings**.

Read more about [user/group Pages][userpages] and [project Pages][projpages].

## Did you fork this project?

If you forked this project for your own use, please go to your project's
**Settings** and remove the forking relationship, which won't be necessary
unless you want to contribute back to the upstream project.

## Troubleshooting

1. CSS is missing! That means two things:

    Either that you have wrongly set up the CSS URL in your templates, or
    your static generator has a configuration option that needs to be explicitly
    set in order to serve static assets under a relative URL.
