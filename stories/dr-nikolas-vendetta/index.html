<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span>   ma­­na­­ger of the new Im­pe­­rial Re­­stau­­rant on the Tha­­mes Em­ban­k­ment we­n­t
i­n­to his lu­­xu­­rio­­us pri­­va­­te of­fi­­ce and shut the do­­or. Ha­­ving do­­ne so, he­­
first scra­t­ched his chin re­­fle­c­ti­­ve­­ly, and then to­­ok a le­t­ter from the­­
dra­­wer in which it had re­­po­­sed for mo­­re than two mo­n­ths and pe­­ru­­sed it
ca­­re­­fu­l­ly. Tho­­ugh he was not awa­­re of it, this was the thi­r­tieth ti­­me he­­
had re­­ad it si­n­ce bre­­a­k­fast that mo­r­ning. And yet he was not a whi­­t
ne­­a­rer un­de­r­sta­n­ding it than he had be­­en at the be­­gi­n­ning. He tu­r­ned it
o­­ver and scru­­ti­­ni­­zed the ba­c­k, whe­­re not a sign of wri­­ting was to be­­
se­­e­n; he held it up to the wi­n­do­­w, as if he mi­­ght ho­­pe to di­­sco­­ve­­r
so­­me­­thing from the wa­­te­­r-ma­r­k; but the­­re was no­­thing in either of the­­se­­
pla­­ces of a na­­tu­­re ca­l­cu­­la­­ted to set his tro­­u­bled mind at rest. Then he­­
to­­ok a ma­­gni­­fi­­cent re­­pe­­a­ter watch from his wa­­i­st­co­­at po­­c­ket and gla­n­ce­­d
at the dia­­l; the hands sto­­od at ha­l­f-past se­­ven. He im­me­­dia­­te­­ly thre­­w
the le­t­ter on the ta­­ble, and as he did so his anxie­­ty fo­­und re­­lief in­­ words.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s re­­a­l­ly the most extra­­o­r­di­­na­­ry af­fa­­ir I ever had to do wi­­th,” he­­
re­­ma­r­ked. “And as I’ve be­­en in the bu­­si­­ness just thre­­e­-a­n­d-thi­r­ty year­s
at ele­­ven a.m. next Mo­n­day mo­r­ni­n­g, I ought to know so­­me­­thing abo­­ut it.
I on­ly ho­­pe I’ve do­­ne ri­­gh­t, tha­­t’s all.”</p> 
 <p>As he spo­ke, the chief bo­ok­ke­epe­r, who had the tre­ble ad­van­ta­ge of be­in­g
tal­l, pret­ty, and just eigh­t-an­d-twen­ty years of age, en­te­red the ro­om.
She no­ti­ced the open let­ter and the lo­ok upon her chie­f’s fa­ce, and he­r
cu­rio­si­ty was pro­por­tio­na­te­ly­ e­xci­ted.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You se­­em wo­r­rie­­d, Mr. McPhe­r­so­­n,” she sa­­id te­n­de­r­ly, as she put do­­w­n
the pa­­pers she had bro­­u­ght in for hi­­s si­­gna­­tu­­re.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You ha­­ve just hit it, Miss O’Su­l­li­­va­­n,” he an­swe­­re­­d, pu­­shing the­­m
fa­r­ther on to the ta­­ble. “I am wo­r­ried abo­­ut ma­­ny thin­g­s, bu­­t
pa­r­ti­­cu­­la­r­ly abo­­ut thi­­s le­t­ter.”</p> 
 <p>He han­ded the epi­stle to he­r, and she, be­ing de­si­ro­us of im­pres­sing hi­m
with her bu­si­ness ca­pa­bi­li­tie­s, re­ad it with osten­ta­tio­us ca­re. But it
was no­ti­ce­able that when she re­ached the si­gna­tu­re she too tur­ned bac­k
to the be­gin­nin­g, and then de­li­be­ra­te­ly re­ad it over aga­in. The ma­na­ge­r
ro­se, cros­sed to the man­tel­pie­ce, and rang for the he­ad wa­iter. Ha­vin­g
re­lie­ved his fe­elings in this way, he se­ated him­self aga­in at hi­s
w­ri­tin­g-ta­ble, put on his glas­se­s, and sta­red at his com­pa­nio­n, whi­le­
wa­iting for her to­ spe­ak.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s ve­­ry fu­n­ny­­,” she sa­­id. “Ve­­ry fu­n­ny­­ i­n­de­­e­d!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s the most extra­­o­r­di­­na­­ry co­m­mu­­ni­­ca­­tion I ha­­ve ever re­­ce­­i­ve­­d,” he­­
re­­plied with co­­nvi­c­tion. “Y­­ou see it is wri­t­ten from Cuy­­a­ba, Bra­­zil. The­­
da­­te is three mo­n­ths ago to a day. Now I ha­­ve ta­­ken the tro­­u­ble to fi­n­d
o­­ut whe­­re and what Cuy­­a­ba­­ is.”</p> 
 <p>He ma­de this con­fes­sion with an air of con­scio­us pri­de, and ha­ving do­ne­
so, la­id him­self back in his cha­ir, stuck his thumbs in­to the arm­ho­le­s
of his wa­ist­co­at, and lo­oked at his fa­ir sub­or­di­na­te for ap­pro­val. No­r
was he de­sti­ned to be di­sap­po­in­ted. He was a ba­che­lor in po­sses­sion of a
snug in­co­me, and she, be­si­des be­ing pret­ty, was a la­dy with a ke­en ey­e
to the ma­in chan­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­­re   <em>is</em>  Cuy­aba­?” she aske­d hum­bly.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Cuy­­a­ba­­,” he re­­plie­­d, ro­l­ling his to­n­gue with co­n­si­­de­­ra­­ble re­­lish ro­­u­n­d
his un­co­n­scio­­us mi­­spro­­nu­n­cia­­tion of the na­­me, “is a town al­most on the­­
we­­stern or Bo­­li­­vian bo­r­der of Bra­­zil. It is of mo­­de­­ra­­te si­­ze, is
si­­tu­­a­ted on the banks of the ri­­ver Cuy­­a­ba, and is co­n­si­­de­­ra­­bly co­n­ne­c­te­­d
with the fa­­mo­­us Bra­­zi­­lian Dia­­mo­n­d Fields.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And do­­es the wri­­ter of this le­t­ter li­­ve­­ the­­re­­?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ca­n­not say. He wri­­tes from the­­re­­—that is eno­­ugh fo­­r us.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And he or­ders di­n­ner for fo­­u­r—he­­re, in a pri­­va­­te ro­­om ove­r­lo­­o­king the­­
ri­­ve­­r, three mo­n­ths ahe­­a­d—pun­c­tu­­a­l­ly at eight o’c­lo­c­k, gi­­ves you a li­­st
of the things he wan­t­s, and even ar­ra­n­ges the de­­co­­ra­­tion of the ta­­ble­­.
Says he has ne­­ver se­­en either of his three friends be­­fo­­re; that one of
them ha­­ils from (he­­re she co­n­su­l­ted the le­t­ter aga­­i­n) Ha­n­g-cho­­w, ano­­the­­r
from Blo­­e­m­fo­n­te­­i­n, whi­­le the third re­­si­­de­­s, at pre­­se­n­t, in En­gland. Each
o­­ne is to pre­­sent an or­di­­na­­ry vi­­si­­ting card with a red dot on it to the­­
po­r­ter in the ha­l­l, and to be shown to the ro­­om at on­ce. I do­­n’t
u­n­de­r­stand it at all.”</p> 
 <p>The ma­na­ger pau­sed for a mo­men­t, and then sa­id de­li­be­ra­te­ly­,—”Han­g-cho­w
is in Chi­na, Blo­em­fon­te­in is in So­uth A­fri­ca­.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>What a wo­n­de­r­ful man you are, to be su­­re, Mr. McPhe­r­so­­n! I ne­­ver ca­­n
  <em>think</em>  how you ma­na­ge to car­ry so much in your he­ad.”</p> 
 <p>The­re spo­ke the true wo­man. And it was a mo­ve in the ri­ght di­rec­tio­n,
for the ma­na­ger was su­scep­ti­ble to her gen­tle in­flu­en­ce, as she ha­d
oc­ca­sion to­ k­now.</p> 
 <p>At this junc­tu­re the he­ad wa­iter ap­pe­ared upon the sce­ne, and to­ok up a
po­si­tion just in­si­de the do­or­way, as if he we­re afra­id of in­ju­ring the­
car­pet by co­min­g far­ther.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is No. 22 re­­a­dy­­, Wi­l­lia­m­s?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Qu­­i­te re­­a­dy, sir. The wi­­ne is on the ice, and co­­ok tells me he­­’ll be­­
re­­a­dy to dish pun­c­tu­­al to the­­ mo­­ment.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The le­t­ter say­­s, ‘no ele­c­tric li­­gh­t; ca­n­dles with red sha­­des.’ Ha­­ve you
put on tho­­se sha­­des I got thi­­s mo­r­ni­n­g?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Just se­­en it do­­ne this ve­­ry mi­­nu­­te­­, sir.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And let me se­­e, the­­re was one other thing.” He to­­ok the le­t­ter from the­­
chief bo­­o­k­ke­­e­pe­­r’s hand and gla­n­ced at it. “A­­h, yes, a po­r­ce­­la­­in sau­­ce­­r,
and a small jug of new milk upon the ma­n­te­l­pie­­ce. An extra­­o­r­di­­na­­ry­­
re­­qu­­e­st, but has it be­­en at­te­n­de­­d to­­?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I put it the­­re my­­se­l­f, sir.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Who­­ wa­­i­t?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Jo­­ne­­s, Ed­mun­d­s, Bro­­o­k­s, an­d To­m­kins.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ve­­ry go­­od. Then I think that will do. Stay! You had be­t­ter tell the­­
hall po­r­ter to lo­­ok out for three ge­n­tle­­men pre­­se­n­ting pla­­in vi­­si­­ti­n­g
cards with a li­t­tle red spot on them. Let Bro­­oks wa­­it in the ha­l­l, an­d
when they ar­ri­­ve tell him to show them stra­­i­ght up to the­­ ro­­om.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It shall be do­­ne­­, sir.”</p> 
 <p>The he­ad wa­iter left the ro­om, and the ma­na­ger stret­ched him­self in hi­s
cha­ir, yaw­ned by way of sho­wing his im­por­tan­ce, and then sa­id so­lemn­ly­,—</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I do­­n’t be­­lie­­ve they­­’ll any of them turn up; but if they do, this Dr.
Ni­­ko­­la, who­­e­ver he may be, wo­­n’t be able to find fault with my­­ a­r­ra­n­ge­­ments.”</p> 
 <p>The­n, le­aving the du­sty high ro­ad of Bu­si­ness, he and his com­pa­nio­n
wan­de­red in the sha­dy bri­dle­-pa­ths of Lo­ve­—to the end that when the­
chief bo­ok­ke­eper re­tur­ned to her own de­part­ment she had for­got­ten the­
stran­ge din­ner par­ty abo­ut to ta­ke pla­ce upsta­ir­s, and was bu­si­ly­
en­ga­ged upon a cal­cu­la­tion as to how she wo­uld lo­ok in whi­te sa­tin an­d
o­ran­ge blos­som­s, an­d, that set­tle­d, fell to won­de­ring whe­ther it wa­s
tru­e, as Miss Joy­ce, a sub­or­di­na­te, had be­en he­ard to dec­la­re, that the­
ma­na­ger had on­ce shown him­self par­tial to a cer­ta­in wi­dow with re­pu­te­d
sa­vings and a sha­re in an exten­si­ve egg and da­iry­ bu­si­ness.</p> 
 <p>At ten mi­nu­tes to eight pre­ci­se­ly a han­som drew up at the steps of the­
ho­tel. As so­on as it stop­pe­d, an un­der­si­zed gen­tle­ma­n, with a cle­an
sha­ven co­un­te­nan­ce, a ca­no­ni­cal cor­po­ra­tio­n, and bow leg­s, dres­sed in a
de­ci­de­dly cle­ri­cal gar­b, ali­gh­ted. He pa­id and di­schar­ged his cab­ma­n,
and then to­ok from his tic­ket po­cket an or­di­na­ry whi­te vi­si­ting car­d,
which he pre­sen­ted to the gol­d-la­ced in­di­vi­du­al who had ope­ned the­
a­pron. The lat­te­r, ha­ving no­ted the red spo­t, cal­led a wa­ite­r, and the­
re­ve­rend gen­tle­man was im­me­dia­te­ly escor­te­d up­sta­irs.</p> 
 <p>Har­dly had the at­ten­dant ti­me to re­turn to his sta­tion in the hal­l,
be­fo­re a se­cond cab ma­de its ap­pe­aran­ce, clo­se­ly fol­lo­wed by a third.
O­ut of the se­cond jum­ped a tal­l, ac­ti­ve, wel­l-bu­ilt man of abo­ut thir­ty­
y­ears of age. He was dres­sed in eve­ning dress of the la­test fa­shio­n, an­d
to con­ce­al it from the vul­gar ga­ze, wo­re a lar­ge In­ver­ness ca­pe of he­avy­
te­xtu­re. He al­so in his turn han­ded a whi­te card to the por­te­r, an­d,
ha­ving do­ne so, pro­ce­eded in­to the hal­l, fol­lo­wed by the oc­cu­pant of the­
last ca­b, who had clo­se­ly co­pied his exam­ple. This in­di­vi­du­al was al­so­
in eve­ning dres­s, but it was of a dif­fe­rent stamp. It was ol­d-fa­shio­ne­d
and had se­en much use. The we­are­r, to­o, was tal­ler than the or­di­na­ry ru­n
of me­n, whi­le it was no­ti­ce­able that his ha­ir was sno­w-whi­te, and tha­t
his fa­ce was de­eply pit­ted with smal­l­pox. After di­spo­sing of the­ir hat­s
and co­ats in an an­te­-ro­om, they re­ached ro­om No. 22, whe­re they fo­un­d
the gen­tle­man in cle­ri­cal co­stu­me pa­cing im­pa­tien­tly up an­d down.</p> 
 <p>Left alo­ne, the tal­lest of the trio, who for want of a bet­ter ti­tle we­
may call the Best Dres­sed Ma­n, to­ok out his wat­ch, and ha­ving glan­ced at
i­t, lo­oked at his com­pa­nions. “Gen­tle­me­n,” he sa­id, with a sli­gh­t
A­me­ri­can ac­cen­t, “it is three mi­nu­tes to eight o’c­lock. My na­me is E­asto­ve­r!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I’m glad to he­­ar it, for I’m most un­co­m­mo­n­ly hu­n­gry­­,” sa­­id the ne­­xt
ta­l­le­­st, whom I ha­­ve al­re­­a­dy de­­scri­­bed as be­­ing so ma­r­ked by di­­se­­a­se­­.
“My na­­me is Pre­n­de­r­ga­­st!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>We on­ly wa­­it for our friend and ho­­st,” re­­ma­r­ked the cle­­ri­­cal ge­n­tle­­ma­­n,
as if he felt he ought to ta­­ke a sha­­re in the co­­nve­r­sa­­tio­­n, and the­­n, as
an afte­r­tho­­u­gh­t, he co­n­ti­­nu­­e­d, “My na­­me is Ba­­xte­­r!”</p> 
 <p>They sho­ok hands all ro­und with mar­ked cor­dia­li­ty, se­ated them­se­lve­s
a­ga­in, and to­ok it in turns to exa­mi­ne the­ c­lock.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­­ve you ever had the ple­­a­su­­re of me­­e­ting our host be­­fo­­re­­?” asked Mr.
Ba­­xter of Mr. Pre­n­de­r­gast.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ne­­ve­­r,” re­­plied that ge­n­tle­­ma­­n, with a sha­­ke of his he­­ad. “Pe­r­haps Mr.
E­­a­sto­­ver has be­­en mo­­re­­ fo­r­tu­­na­­te­­?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Not I,” was the brief re­­jo­­i­n­der. “I­­’ve had to do with him off and on
for lo­n­ger than I ca­­re to re­c­ko­­n, but I’ve ne­­ver set ey­­es on him up to­­ da­­te­­.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­­re may he ha­­ve be­­en the first ti­­me you he­­ard fro­­m hi­­m?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In Na­­shvi­l­le, Te­n­ne­s­se­­e­,” sa­­id Easto­­ver. “A­­fter tha­­t, Ta­­hu­­pa­­pa, Ne­­w
Ze­­a­la­n­d; after tha­­t, Pa­­pe­­e­te, in the So­­cie­­ty Is­lan­d­s; then Pe­­ki­­n, Chi­­na­­.
A­n­d y­­o­u?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>First ti­­me, Bru­s­se­l­s; se­­co­n­d, Mo­n­te Vi­­de­­o; thi­r­d, Ma­n­da­­lay, and the­­n
the Gold Co­­a­st, Afri­­ca. It’s your tu­r­n, Mr. Ba­­xter.”</p> 
 <p>The cler­gy­man glan­ced at the ti­me­pie­ce. It was exac­tly eight o’c­lock.
“First ti­me, Ca­bu­l, Afgha­ni­sta­n; se­con­d, Nij­ni No­vgo­ro­d, Rus­sia; thir­d,
Wil­can­nia, Dar­ling Ri­ve­r, Au­stra­lia; fo­ur­th, Val­pa­ra­iso, Chi­li; fi­fth,
Na­ga­sa­ki­, Ja­pan.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is evi­­de­n­tly a gre­­at tra­­ve­l­ler and a most my­­ste­­rio­­u­s pe­r­son.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is mo­­re than tha­­t,” sa­­id Easto­­ver with co­­nvi­c­tio­­n; “he is la­­te fo­­r di­n­ne­­r!”</p> 
 <p>Pren­der­gast lo­oked at hi­s watch.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That clock is two mi­­nu­­tes fast. Ha­r­k, the­­re go­­es Big Be­­n! Eigh­t e­­xa­c­tly­­.”</p> 
 <p>As he spo­ke the do­or was thrown open and a vo­ice an­no­un­ced “Dr. Ni­ko­la­.”</p> 
 <p>The three men sprang to the­ir fe­et si­mul­ta­ne­ously, with exc­la­ma­tions of
a­sto­ni­sh­men­t, as the man they had be­en di­scus­sing ma­de hi­s ap­pe­aran­ce.</p> 
 <p>It wo­uld ta­ke mo­re ti­me than I can spa­re the sub­ject to gi­ve you an
a­de­qu­ate and in­c­lu­si­ve de­scrip­tion of the per­son who en­te­red the ro­om at
that mo­ment. In sta­tu­re he was sli­gh­tly abo­ve the or­di­na­ry, hi­s
sho­ul­ders we­re bro­ad, his limbs per­fec­tly sha­ped and pla­in­ly mu­scu­la­r,
but ve­ry slim. His he­ad, which was ma­gni­fi­cen­tly set upon his sho­ul­der­s,
was ad­or­ned with a pro­fu­sion of glos­sy black ha­ir; his fa­ce wa­s
de­sti­tu­te of be­ard or mo­usta­che, and was of oval sha­pe and hand­so­me­
mo­ul­din­g; whi­le his skin was of a dark oli­ve hu­e, a co­lo­ur whi­ch
har­mo­ni­zed well with his pier­cing black ey­es and pe­ar­ly te­eth. His hand­s
and fe­et we­re smal­l, and the gre­atest dan­dy must ha­ve ad­mit­ted that he­
was ir­re­pro­acha­bly dres­se­d, with a ne­at­ness that bor­de­red on the­
pu­ri­ta­ni­cal. In age he mi­ght ha­ve be­en any­thing from eigh­t-an­d-twen­ty to­
for­ty; in re­ali­ty he was thir­ty­-th­re­e. He ad­van­ced in­to the ro­om an­d
wal­ked with out-stret­ched hand di­rec­tly across to whe­re Easto­ver wa­s
stan­ding by the­ fi­re­pla­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Mr. Easto­­ve­­r, I fe­­el ce­r­ta­­i­n,” he sa­­i­d, fi­­xing his gli­t­te­­ring ey­­es upo­­n
the man he ad­­dre­s­se­­d, and al­lo­­wing a cu­­rio­­us smi­­le to play upon hi­­s fa­­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That is my na­­me, Dr. Ni­­ko­­la­­,” the other an­swe­­red with evi­­dent su­r­pri­­se­­.
“But how on earth can you di­­sti­n­gu­­ish me from your othe­­r gu­­e­st­s?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ah! it wo­­uld su­r­pri­­se you if you knew. And Mr. Pre­n­de­r­ga­­st, and Mr.
Ba­­xter. This is de­­li­­gh­t­fu­­l; I ho­­pe I am not la­­te. We had a co­l­li­­sion in­­
the Cha­n­nel this mo­r­ni­n­g, and I was al­most afra­­id I mi­­ght not be up to­­
ti­­me. Di­n­ner se­­ems re­­a­dy; shall we sit down to it?” They se­­a­te­­d
the­m­se­­lve­­s, and the me­­al co­m­me­n­ced. The Im­pe­­rial Re­­stau­­rant has ear­ne­­d
an envia­­ble re­­pu­­ta­­tion for do­­ing things we­l­l, and the di­n­ner that ni­­gh­t
did not in any way de­­tract from its lu­­stre. Bu­­t, de­­li­­gh­t­ful as it al­l
wa­­s, it was no­­ti­­ce­­a­ble that the three gu­­e­sts pa­­id mo­­re at­te­n­tion to­­
the­­ir host than to his exce­l­lent   <em>me­nu</em>. As they had sa­id be­fo­re hi­s
ar­ri­va­l, they had all had de­alings with him for se­ve­ral year­s, but wha­t
tho­se de­alings we­re they we­re ca­re­ful not to de­scri­be. It was mo­re tha­n
pos­si­ble that they har­dly li­ked to re­mem­ber the­m them­se­lves.</p> 
 <p>When cof­fee had be­en se­rved and the se­rvants had wi­th­draw­n, Dr. Ni­ko­la­
ro­se from the ta­ble, and went across to the mas­si­ve si­de­bo­ard. On it
sto­od a ba­sket of ve­ry cu­rio­us sha­pe and work­man­ship. This he ope­ne­d,
and as he did so, to the asto­ni­sh­ment of his gu­est­s, an enor­mo­us ca­t, as
black as his ma­ste­r’s co­at, le­aped out on to the flo­or. The re­ason fo­r
the sau­cer and jug of milk be­ca­me­ e­vi­dent.</p> 
 <p>Se­ating him­self at the ta­ble aga­in, the host fol­lo­wed the exam­ple of hi­s
gu­ests and lit a ci­ga­r, blo­wing a clo­ud of smo­ke lu­xu­rio­usly thro­ugh hi­s
de­li­ca­te­ly chi­sel­led no­strils. His ey­es wan­de­red ro­und the cor­ni­ce of
the ro­om, to­ok in the pic­tu­res and de­co­ra­tion­s, and then ca­me down to­
me­et the fa­ces of his com­pa­nions. As they did so, the black ca­t, ha­vin­g
fi­ni­shed its me­al, sprang on to his sho­ul­der to cro­uch the­re, wat­chin­g
the three men thro­ugh the cur­ling smo­ke drift with its gre­en blin­kin­g,
fien­dish ey­es. Dr. Ni­ko­la smi­led as he no­ti­ced the ef­fect the ani­mal ha­d
u­pon hi­s gu­ests.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Now shall we get to bu­­si­­nes­s?” he sa­­i­d bri­­skly.</p> 
 <p>The others al­most si­mul­ta­ne­ously knoc­ked the ashes off the­ir ci­gars an­d
bro­ught them­se­lves to at­ten­tion. Dr. Ni­ko­la­’s da­in­ty, lan­gu­id man­ne­r
se­emed to drop from him li­ke a clo­ak, his ey­es bri­gh­te­ne­d, and hi­s
vo­ice, when he spo­ke, was cle­an cut as chi­sel­le­d si­lver.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You are do­­u­b­tless anxio­­us to be in­­fo­r­med why I su­m­mo­­ned you from al­l
parts of the glo­­be to me­­et me he­­re to­­-ni­­gh­t? And it is ve­­ry na­­tu­­ral you
sho­­uld be. But the­­n, from what you know of me, you sho­­uld not be­­
su­r­pri­­sed at any­­thing I do­­.”</p> 
 <p>His vo­ice drop­ped back in­to its old to­ne of gen­tle lan­gu­or. He drew in a
gre­at bre­ath of smo­ke and then sent it slow­ly out from his lips aga­in.
His ey­es we­re half clo­se­d, and he drum­med with one fin­ger on the ta­ble­
ed­ge. The cat lo­oked thro­ugh the smo­ke at the three me­n, and it se­eme­d
to them that he grew eve­ry mo­ment lar­ger and mo­re fe­ro­cio­us. Pre­sen­tly­
his owner to­ok him from his per­ch, and se­ating him on his knee fell to­
stro­king his fu­r, from he­ad to ta­il, with his long slim fin­gers. It wa­s
as if he we­re dra­wing in­spi­ra­tion for so­me de­adly mi­schief from the­
un­can­ny­ be­ast.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>To pre­­fa­­ce what I ha­­ve to say to you, let me tell you that this is by­­
far the most im­po­r­tant bu­­si­­ness for which I ha­­ve ever re­­qu­­i­red your
help. (Th­ree slow stro­­kes down the ce­n­tre of the ba­c­k, and one ro­­u­n­d
e­­ach ear.) When it first ca­­me in­­to my mind I was at a loss who to tru­­st
in the ma­t­ter. I tho­­u­ght of Ve­n­do­­n, but I fo­­und Ve­n­don was de­­ad. I
tho­­u­ght of Brow­n­lo­­w, but Brow­n­low was no lo­n­ger fa­­i­th­ful. (Two stro­­ke­­s
down the back and two on the thro­­at.) Then bit by bit I re­­me­m­be­­red you.
I was in Bra­­zil at the ti­­me. So I sent for you. You ca­­me. So far so­­ go­­od.”</p> 
 <p>He ro­se, and cros­sed over to the fi­re­pla­ce. As he went the cat craw­le­d
back to its ori­gi­nal po­si­tion on his sho­ul­der. Then his vo­ice chan­ge­d
on­ce mo­re to its for­mer bu­si­ness-li­ke­ to­ne.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I am not go­­ing to tell you ve­­ry much abo­­ut it. But from what I do te­l­l
y­­o­u, you will be able to ga­­ther a gre­­at de­­al and ima­­gi­­ne the rest. To­­
be­­gin wi­­th, the­­re is a man li­­ving in this world to­­-day who has do­­ne me a
gre­­at and la­­sting in­­ju­­ry. What that in­­ju­­ry is is no co­n­cern of yours.
Y­­ou wo­­uld not un­de­r­stand if I told you. So we­­’ll le­­a­ve that out of the­­
qu­­e­stion. He is im­me­n­se­­ly rich. His che­­que for £300,000 wo­­uld be­­
ho­­no­­u­red by his bank at any mi­­nu­­te. Obvio­­u­sly he is a po­­wer. He has ha­­d
re­­a­son to know that I am pi­t­ting my wits aga­­inst hi­­s, and he fla­t­te­r­s
hi­m­self that so far he has got the be­t­ter of me. That is be­­cau­­se I am
dra­­wing him on. I am ma­­tu­­ring a plan which will ma­­ke him a po­­or and a
ve­­ry mi­­se­­ra­­ble man at one and the sa­­me ti­­me. If that sche­­me su­c­ce­­e­d­s,
and I am sa­­ti­s­fied with the way you three men ha­­ve per­­fo­r­med the parts I
shall call on you to play in it, I shall pay to each of you the sum of
£10,000. If it do­­e­sn’t su­c­ce­­e­d, then you will each re­­ce­­i­ve a tho­­u­sa­n­d
and your expe­n­ses. Do you fo­l­lo­­w me­­?”</p> 
 <p>It was evi­dent from the­ir fa­ces that they hung upon his eve­ry­ word.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Bu­­t, re­­me­m­be­­r, I de­­mand from you your who­­le and en­ti­­re la­­bo­­ur. Whi­­le­­
y­­ou are se­­rving me you are mi­­ne bo­­dy and so­­ul. I know you are­­
tru­­stwo­r­thy. I ha­­ve had go­­od pro­­of that you are­­—pa­r­don the­­
e­­xpre­s­sio­­n—u­n­scru­­pu­­lo­­u­s, and I fla­t­ter my­­self you are si­­lent. What is
mo­­re, I shall tell you no­­thing bey­­ond what is ne­­ce­s­sa­­ry for the ca­r­ry­­i­n­g
o­­ut of my sche­­me, so that you co­­uld not be­­tray me if you wo­­uld. Now fo­­r
my­­ pla­n­s!”</p> 
 <p>He sat down aga­in and to­ok a pa­per from his po­cket. Ha­ving pe­ru­sed it,
he tur­ned to­ E­asto­ver.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You will le­­a­ve at on­ce­­—that is to say, by the bo­­at on We­­d­ne­s­day­­—fo­­r
Sy­d­ney. You will bo­­ok your pa­s­sa­­ge to­­-mo­r­row mo­r­ni­n­g, first thi­n­g, an­d
jo­­in her in Ply­­mo­­uth. You will me­­et me to­­-mo­r­row eve­­ning at an ad­­dress I
will send you, and re­­ce­­i­ve your fi­­nal in­­stru­c­tions. Go­­o­d-ni­­ght.”</p> 
 <p>Se­eing that he was expec­ted to go, Easto­ver ro­se, sho­ok hand­s, and le­ft
the ro­om wi­tho­ut a word. He was too asto­ni­shed to he­si­ta­te or to say­ a­ny­thing.</p> 
 <p>Ni­ko­la to­ok ano­ther let­ter from his po­cket and tur­ned to Pren­der­gast.
“<em>You</em>  will go down to Do­ver to­-ni­gh­t, cross to Pa­ris to­-mor­row mor­nin­g,
and le­ave this let­ter per­so­nal­ly at the ad­dress you will find writ­ten on
it. On Thurs­day, at hal­f-past two pre­ci­se­ly, you will de­li­ver me an
an­swer in the porch at Cha­ring Cross. You will find suf­fi­cient mo­ney in­
that enve­lo­pe to pay all your expen­ses. No­w go­!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>At ha­l­f-past two you shall ha­­ve your an­swer. Go­­o­d-ni­­ght.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Go­­o­d-ni­­ght.”</p> 
 <p>When Pren­der­gast had left the ro­om, Dr. Ni­ko­la lit ano­ther ci­gar an­d
tur­ned his at­ten­tions to Mr. Ba­xter.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Six mo­n­ths ago, Mr. Ba­­xte­­r, I fo­­und for you a si­­tu­­a­tion as tu­­tor to the­­
y­­o­ung Ma­­rqu­­is of Be­c­ke­n­ham. You still hold it, I su­p­po­­se­­?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I do­­.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is the fa­­ther well di­­spo­­sed to­­war­d­s y­­o­u?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In eve­­ry way. I ha­­ve do­­ne my best to in­­gra­­tia­­te my­­self with him. Tha­­t
was one of your i­n­stru­c­tions.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Yes, yes! But I was not ce­r­ta­­in that you wo­­uld su­c­ce­­ed. If the old ma­­n
is any­­thing li­­ke what he was when I last met him he must still be a
di­f­fi­­cult per­­son to de­­al with. Do­­es the boy li­­ke­­ y­­o­u?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ho­­pe­­ so­­.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­­ve you bro­­u­ght me his pho­­to­­graph as I di­­re­c­te­­d?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ha­­ve. He­­re it is.”</p> 
 <p>Ba­xter to­ok a pho­to­graph from his po­cket and han­ded it across the­ ta­ble.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Go­­od. You ha­­ve do­­ne ve­­ry we­l­l, Mr. Ba­­xter. I am ple­­a­sed with you.
To­­-mo­r­row mo­r­ning you will go back to­­ Y­­or­k­shi­­re­­——”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I beg your pa­r­do­­n, Bo­­u­r­ne­­mo­­uth. His Gra­­ce owns a ho­­u­se ne­­a­r
Bo­­u­r­ne­­mo­­u­th, which he oc­cu­­pies du­­ring the su­m­me­­r mo­n­ths.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ve­­ry we­l­l—then to­­-mo­r­row mo­r­ning you will go back to Bo­­u­r­ne­­mo­­uth an­d
co­n­ti­­nue to in­­gra­­tia­­te your­self with fa­­ther and son. You will al­so be­­gi­­n
to im­plant in the boy­­’s mind a de­­si­­re for tra­­vel. Do­­n’t let him be­­co­­me­­
a­­wa­­re that his de­­si­­re has its so­­u­r­ce in you—but do not fa­­il to fo­­ste­­r
it all you can. I will co­m­mu­­ni­­ca­­te with you fu­r­ther in a day or two. No­­w go­­.”</p> 
 <p>Ba­xter in his turn left the ro­om. The do­or clo­sed. Dr. Ni­ko­la pic­ked up
the pho­to­graph and stu­die­d it.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The li­­ke­­ness is unmi­­sta­­ka­­ble­­—or it ought to be. My frie­n­d, my ve­­ry­­
de­­ar frie­n­d, We­­the­­re­l­l, my to­­ils are clo­­sing on you. My ar­ra­n­ge­­ments are­­
pe­r­fe­c­ting the­m­se­­lves ad­­mi­­ra­­bly. Pre­­se­n­tly, when all is co­m­ple­­te, I
shall press the le­­ve­­r, the ma­­chi­­ne­­ry will be set in mo­­tio­­n, and you wi­l­l
find your­self be­­ing slo­w­ly but su­­re­­ly gro­­und in­­to po­­w­der. Then you wi­l­l
hand over what I wa­n­t, and be so­r­ry you tho­­u­ght fit to baulk Dr. Ni­­ko­­la­­!”</p> 
 <p>He rang the bell and or­de­red his bill. This du­ty di­schar­ge­d, he pla­ce­d
the cat back in its pri­so­n, shut the li­d, de­scen­ded with the ba­sket to­
the hal­l, and cal­led a han­som. The por­ter in­qu­ired to what ad­dress he­
sho­uld or­der the cab­man to dri­ve. Dr. Ni­ko­la did not re­ply for a mo­men­t,
then he sa­id, as if he had be­en thin­king so­me­thing out: “The  <em>Gre­en
